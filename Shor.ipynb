    "### Complete, not optimized and general implementation of Shor's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will see a fully detailed implementation of the Shor algorithm. This is done only for learning purposes, so it will not be optimized and use the best implementation, but will be fully functionnal on the simulator and technically on real quantum devices (provided there is enough qubits of course, which is not the case). However, it is very unlikely any current real hardware will be able to handle such long algorithm (it is really not optimized).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want the code to be usable by the real devices, we can't use some of the tricks used in recent algorithms, involving measure feedback or qubit reseting. However, it won't use any a priori knowledge on the number $N$ we want to factorize, so it will be completly general and work on any number (with big enough hardware). With today's public hardware we can factorize $15=3\\times 5$ on the 32 qubits simulator (we need 25 qubits).\n",

    "The part we can exponentially accelerate is the period finding. Because we can do Fourier transform on quantum states, we can detect patterns. And we know the modular exponentiation $A^x\\mod N$ is periodic, so it will have repeating values. This is the main goal of the quantum algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "![shor.PNG](images/shor.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a superposition of all possible configuration for $x$, then feed it into a component that takes a qubit register containing the (supeposition of the) exponent, and an other initialized at zero for the result, and gives back the exponent and put the (superposition of the) result in the other, and then do a Quantum Fourier Transform on the exponent register to have remaining only the ones multiples of $\\frac{M}{r}$, with $M=2^m$ the maximum exponent $x$ and $r$ the period we want to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest $M$ the better, because we measure $S$, the closest integer to $k\\frac{M}{r}$. So, in order to find $r$, we can apply a classical algorithm on $\\frac{S}{M}=\\frac{k}{r}\\pm\\frac{1}{2M}$, which returns both $k$ and $r$ if $k$ is not a divisor of $r$ (or share any divisor with $r$), and if the error term $\\pm\\frac{1}{2M}$ isn't too big. In fact let $n\\in \\mathbb{N},\\ 2^{n}\\leq N=PQ<2^{n+1}$ the number of bits of the integer $N$ we want to factorize, then we want $n<2m$. \n",

We dont have A and B two registers containing the numbers to be multiplied, but A empty with sufficient size, and the value $a$ to precompute the successive $a2^i$. The idea is to do successive additions between the previous result (starting at zero), and either 0 or $1\\times a2^i$ if both the control qubit and the $i$-th bit of b is 1.

And each multiplication requires $n$ modular additions, $2n$ value input in register A (putting $a2^i$ then removing it, for each bit of B), then one extra check to put $b$ in Y if not control, taking $n+2$ gates.

    "Finally, we can build the modular exponentiation!

That's why we needed controlled multiplication, to have the multiplication done only if $x_i$ is 1. The only issue is that, because the multiplication needs an empty register to correctly function, we need to reset it each time, so for each bit of X (the exposant), we will need to do two multiplication, and switch two registers.\n",

    "We have redefined the two previous Shor functions to add the quantum part. The main function qperiodfinder creates the circuit (call to shor_quant), and then runs it on the 32 qubits simulator. We can see we hard-coded the max number of qubits to be 25 because even the 32 qubits public simulator takes a lot of time to run the algorithm. We also fixed the number $A$ for which we want to find the modular period, because otherwise it wouldn't be interesting (either trivial period or a direct find).\n",

Here that's not (exactly) the case, because $S=16$ so $\\frac{S}{M} = \\frac{1}{4}$, so $k=1$ and $r=4$. But it could have been $k=2$ and then we would have found $r=2$, the wrong result!\n",

But, in general, it is not likely to be the case. The function fracf can detect close simplified fraction, like if we give it 100000 and 66667, it will recognize the fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$, but can't give $\\frac{4}{6}$, so if $k=4$ and $r=6$, it would give the wrong answer."

    "One remark we can have is the depth of the circuit: a little bit over 3000. It's way too big for it to run on a quantum computer for now. But if we have access to a perfect quantum computer, we could theoretically run this exact code on it, which was the purpose of this little exercise. In fact we would never run such algorithm because it is heavily improvable (for example the X register can be reduced from $2n$ qubits minimum to only one qubit if we can do measure feedback), but it works and is understandable, which is already great given how complicated Shor algorithm sounds when hearing about it first."
