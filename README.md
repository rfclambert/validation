All my work in Quantum Computing from these past months.
Here are all the Jupyter Notebooks I made to present my work to my colleagues or students from Ensimag.
There is a Tutorial which has been included in the documentation of Qiskit (about custom feature maps),<br/>
a presentation of the Grover Algorithm,<br/>
a presentation of a simple way to produce random numbers using a Quantum Computer,<br/>
a presentation of a SVM using a quantum Kernel,<br/>
a presentation of Shor's algorithm and an introduction to Quantum Computing for the Ensimag.<br/>

In the directory TESTQ is all the implementations of different algorithms I did,
plus some probabilistic work on 3SAT made by my colleague, mtillet. 
Implementations include: a lot of QOL function in src/General.py,<br/>
implementation of the quantum SVM algorithm (both ways: with Variational Circuit or not),<br/>
implementation of the qGAN (a GAN made to help load distributions in a Quantum Computer),<br/>
implementation of Shor's Algorithm (a General Algorithm which works for every number, provided we have a strong enough Quantum Computer),<br/>
implementation of the Quantum Wavelet Transform,<br/>
implementation of a good nCNOT (could be better than the one in Qiskit?)and <br/>
implementations of some toy algorithms (Bernstein Vazirani, Deutsch Jozsa)

And a test file in python/tests.py to test some parts of the code.
