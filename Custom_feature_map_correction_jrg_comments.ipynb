    "Support vector machines (SVM) address the problem of supervised learning through the construction of a classifier. Havlicek *et al*. proposed two strategies to design a quantum SVM, namely the Quantum Kernel Estimator and the Quantum Variatonal Classifier. Both of these strategies use data that is provided classically and encodes it in the quantum state space through a quantum feature map.[1] The choice of which feature map to use is important and may depend on the given dataset we want to classify. In this tutorial, we show how to configure new feature maps in Aqua and explore their impact on the accuracy of the quantum classifier.\n",

Support vector machine classifiers find a hyperplane separating each vector $|\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\rangle\\langle\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)|$ depending on their label, supported by a reduced amount of vectors (the so-called support vectors). A key element of the feature map is not only the use of quantum state space as a feature space but also the way data are mapped into this high dimensional space.\n",

    "Constructing feature maps based on quantum circuits that are hard to simulate classically is an important steps towards obtaining a quantum advantage over classical approaches.

The parameters $d$, $\\phi_S$ and $P_k$ are mutable for both classification algorithms (Quantum Variational Classifier and Quantum Kernel Estimator) in Aqua.

This gives $n$ singeltons $S=\\{i\\}$, and, depending on the connectivity graph of the quantum device, up to $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ couples to encode non-linear interactions.\n",
