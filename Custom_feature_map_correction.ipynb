    "## Custom feature map for SVM Classifier in Aqua\n",

    "The key part of quantum SVM, the kernel that really distinguish it from classical SVM kernels (such as Gaussian or Polynomial Kernels), is the quantum feature map used to map data on a high dimensional, hard to classicaly simulate, Hilbert space. Havlicek *et al*. proposed two strategies to design quantum SVM. Remarkably for both strategies, namely Quantum Kernel Estimator and Quantum Variational Classifier, the quantum feature map used is the part of the algorithm that will have the most impact, as it's the part of the circuit which encodes the data.\n",
